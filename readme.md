## Project Overview
This repository is intended for machine learning experimentation and development. It includes basic setup files and a structure to kickstart your ML project. Add details about your specific ML project here, such as:
- Purpose of the project
- Technologies used (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Dataset information (if applicable)

## Setup Instructions
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vinayak1729-web/mlproject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mlprojects
   ```
3. Make a virtual env:
   ```bash
    python -m venv .env
   ```
   if you are restricted then
    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
   else
   ```bash
   .env\Scripts\Activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies (update with your specific requirements, e.g., `requirements.txt`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Configure your environment (e.g., set up virtual environments or API keys if needed).

## Git Commands

### Creating a New Repository
To initialize and push a new repository to GitHub, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
echo "# mlproject" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/vinayak1729-web/mlproject.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Pushing an Existing Repository
If you have an existing local repository and want to push it to GitHub, use these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/vinayak1729-web/mlproject.git
git config --global user.email "enter your email to collab"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

```
